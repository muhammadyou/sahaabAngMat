It has been all hard work and late night collaborations in the last two years. And it was worth it. We're well on our way to launch the first NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) in Etisalat, a telecom cloud powered by Internet-age open software and hardware, to unlock our future agility. The first virtualised services on top of the NFVI shall be those of the EPC, e.g. vPGW, vSGW and vMME. Next, together with the CPE team, Business Marketing and Consumer Marketing, we aim to cloudify the CPE for businesses and homes, respectively. As a golden rule, customer-centric service orchestration shall be at the heart of all these projects."},{para:"As and when services become ripe for cloudification, the NFVI will need to expand from the current 5 sites to the rest of the network, enabling a software-defined fluid infrastructure fit for our transformation to the digital age.

Nonetheless, the expansion will take time and will entail huge efforts and a myriad of challenges, and no single team in any telecom can go at it alone.
